he MVC pattern is essentially this:

Model: What to display. 

View: How it�s displayed. This uses xml. A view is attached to the model and gets the data.

Controller: Reacts to events (ex. The Activity Lifecycle, user input) This be the activity



public static Locale getDefault ()
Returns the user's preferred locale. This may have been overridden for this process with setDefault(Locale).
Since the user's locale changes dynamically, avoid caching this value. Instead, use this method to look it up for each use.
